## Project Advantages

### Pure Frontend Architecture, Seamless Integration
- **Zero Backend Dependencies**: Adopts pure frontend architecture design, deployment complete with a single JavaScript file
- **Cross-System Integration**: Can be easily embedded in any B/S mode system, quickly empowering existing projects with AI capabilities
- **Standalone Operation**: Simply import the packaged JS file to run independently, no additional configuration or backend services required
- **Plug and Play**: Supports quick integration in both new and old systems, significantly reducing development and deployment costs

### Basic Technology Stack, Extreme Compatibility
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Built on native JavaScript and jQuery, avoiding heavy frameworks
- **Wide Compatibility**: Not dependent on specific frontend frameworks (such as Vue, React), compatible with almost all B/S systems
- **Low Invasiveness**: Isolated through CSS namespace, minimizing impact on the host system
- **Efficient Loading**: Optimized resource packaging strategy to ensure fast loading and response in various environments

### Modular Design, Easy to Extend
- **Clear Code Structure**: Adopts modular architecture, core functions are split into independent modules (util.js, config.js, api.js, etc.)
- **Unified Entry Management**: Uses index.js as a unified entry for easy maintenance and management
- **Development Friendly**: Development mode mimicking modern frontend frameworks, reducing the learning threshold for secondary development
- **Flexible Expansion**: Supports custom model configuration, application configuration, and interface customization to meet different scenario requirements

## Environment Requirements
nodejs>=20
npm>=10

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Native JavaScript + jQuery
- **Style Processing**: Native CSS + Bootstrap Icons + Font Awesome
- **Packaging Tool**: Webpack 5
- **Code Transpilation**: Babel
- **UI Components**: Layer popups, SimpleMDE editor
- **Data Storage**: IndexDB
- **AI Interface**: Supports VLLM, Ollama, OpenAI and other large model services compatible with OpenAI API format

## Quick Start

* Clone the code:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Midas/kurumi.git
```

* Initialize:

```shell
npm run init
```

* Build:

``` shell
npm run build
```

Packaged files are in the dist directory: ./dist/kurumi-chat.js. A sample HTML file (index.html) has been created in the project root directory. You can use nginx to publish this page or open the file directly in a browser to view the component effects.

Note: The index.html page is for testing purposes only. To test the complete functionality, you need to configure the actual AI model interface address, application configuration and other parameters in the index.html page.

## Installation and Usage

### Import Method

1. **Directly Import the Packaged File**

```html
<!-- Import at the bottom of the HTML page -->

## Component Secondary Development

To improve the integration friendliness and user experience of the project, the following key modifications have been made to third-party components:

### Style Isolation and Namespace
- Added `kurumi-chat-` prefix to all CSS class names of the Layer popup component
- Effectively avoid conflicts and confusion with the host system's CSS styles
- Ensure style consistency when introduced in any system

### Localization and Interface Optimization
- Fully localized the SimpleMDE editor, including interface elements, button text, and prompt information
- Optimized typesetting and display effects in Chinese context
- Improved the user experience for Chinese users

### Theme Support Enhancement
- Deeply modified the component CSS to natively support light and dark theme modes
- Added theme switching capability for all UI elements (including Layer popups and SimpleMDE editor)
- Use CSS variables to implement unified management and dynamic switching of theme colors

### Plugin Adaptation and Customization
- Customized the interaction behavior and animation effects of the Layer popup according to project requirements
- Adjusted the style and functionality of the SimpleMDE editor to make it consistent with the overall UI style
- Preserved the core functionality of the original plugins while optimizing the integration experience
